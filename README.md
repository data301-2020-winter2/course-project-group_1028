The dataset we have chosen is a from a very reliable source(UCI Machine Learning Repository) which makes it a fit choice for our analysis. With no missing values and explicitly recorded data for bikes, there are several questions that we aim to answer with the data provided in the Bike Sharing dataset itself. With increase in awareness of the environmental harms caused by motor vehicle emissions and health benefits of cycling, bike sharing systems are gaining popularity all around the globe. Hence, we went ahead with this particular dataset.

These are some of the following questions we aim to explore through our analysis:
1. Which is the most favourable weather for cycling? 
2. Which is the least favourable weather for cycling? 
3. Which days are cycles borrowed the most? (Histogram for each day) 
4. Which is the most favourable month for cycling? And why? (Average rental hour per month) 
5. Compare average hours of cycling for casual and registered users and draw conclusions based on it.
6. Weekdays or working-days, which one is more popular for renting a bike? 
7. Best conditions for cycling? (considering humidity, wind speed, temperature)


We aim to create a dashboard by the end of our project to make it easier to visualize the enormous collection of data and analyze it clearly.
