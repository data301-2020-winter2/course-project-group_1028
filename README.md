## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The dataset we have chosen is a from a very reliable source(UCI Machine Learning Repository) which makes it a fit choice for our analysis. With no missing values and explicitly recorded data for bikes, there are several questions that we aim to answer with the data provided in the Bike Sharing dataset itself. With increase in awareness of the environmental harms caused by motor vehicle emissions and health benefits of cycling, bike sharing systems are gaining popularity all around the globe. Hence, we went ahead with this particular dataset.

These are some of the following questions we aim to explore through our analysis:
1. Which is the most favourable weather for cycling? 
2. Which is the least favourable weather for cycling? 
3. Which days are cycles borrowed the most? (Histogram for each day) 
4. Which is the most favourable month for cycling? And why? (Average rental hour per month) 
5. Compare average hours of cycling for casual and registered users and draw conclusions based on it.
6. Weekdays or working-days, which one is more popular for renting a bike? 
7. Best conditions for cycling? (considering humidity, wind speed, temperature)


We aim to create a dashboard by the end of our project to make it easier to visualize the enormous collection of data and analyze it clearly. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was provided by “Capital Bikeshare”, a bicycle sharing system in multiple counties around Washington D.C. and Virginia. The data contains detailed information in bike sharing in terms of days and hours. For our project, we’ll be using the hours data. This data presents us with data on how many people use bikesharing on every hour of every day for 2 full years, taking the temperature, weather, humidity, wind, and whether the user is registered or not. The data itself is collected from the 1st of January 2011 up until the 31st of December 2012.  The dataset was created by the company to provide free public bike sharing information in hopes that they can be useful for people like developers, engineers, statisticians, and artists for the sake of analysis, development, visualization and more. The data itself is collected as it records the time and date when a bike is unlocked from a kiosk, how long it was used, and it matches it with the weather, temperature, air humidity, and windspeed that was recorded on each day.
